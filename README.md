# üêÆ CowComic üìò

Welcome to CowComic, a React Web Application where users can get a book recommended after completing a survey! If users want to save their book recommendation, they have the option to register for an account/login to their existing account to save books.  

## Why "CowComic"?

Cal Poly Pomona, though known for broncos, has cute cow merchandise (stickers, plushies, etc.) to represent CPP. Since our website has to do with books, the name "CowComic" was created!
